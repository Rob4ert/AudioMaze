He wants to play.”<br />\n“Oh, yeah? Is that why you’re yawning?”<br />\nTimmy shrugged. “Sometimes I throw paper balls for him to catch.”<br />\nI thought about the crumpled paper balls I had seen in his room recently. “Well, tell him I don’t like messy rooms.”<br />\n<br />\nMiss L pulled me to one side when I picked Timmy up that afternoon. He’s been sleeping in class, she said.<br />\nI messaged my friends for advice on the ride home. I did not tell my mum. News of Timmy not sleeping was sure to go back to Lina.<br />\nTire him out, a friend suggested. So that evening, I gave Timmy free rein at the playground. He clambered up the tubes like he was immune to gravity. He ran across the bridge so many times I was sure he left grooves. I dissuaded him from jumping off the swing. When we got home, I was exhausted.<br />\nTimmy showed me a drawing he’d done in class. A crayon-outlined bed and beneath it, a circular mass of squiggles with two bulbous eyes. It was eating an ice-cream cone.<br />\nI decided to sleep in Timmy’s room that night. I read to Timmy and watched as his eyelids turned droopy. When he was asleep, I retired to my makeshift bed.<br />\nI was almost asleep when I heard an unmistakable thud.<br />\nIt came from the gap below the bed. I jolted upright, listening hard. No other sound except for the ticking alarm clock. My heart was pounding.<br />\nWas I mistaken?<br />\nThen a crumpled ball shot out, rolling to a stop near my feet. There was a scrambling sound and another thump, and this time my son was roused from his sleep. He looked at me groggily.<br />\n“Dad?”<br />\nI moved. I took a tennis racket from Timmy’s closet. I swept the racket below the bed. Nothing there but dust. I heard what sounded like whimpering.<br />\n<br />\nThe following night, Timmy slept in my room and I took his room instead.<br />\nI waited for ages, but the room remained silent. Finally, I climbed down onto the floor. I looked under Timmy’s bed and threw a paper ball in.<br />\nNothing happened for a few seconds. Then there was a scrambling sound, and the ball shot out onto my lap.<br />\n<br />\nOn the third night, I brought Timmy back to his bedroom. When he fell asleep, I sat down and played catch with the crevasse beneath his bed. After a while the balls stopped rolling back. If I listened hard, I could hear two sets of snoring.<br />\nI set a sandwich underneath the bed before I left the room. Ice cream was not a healthy snack, even for monsters under the bed. The plate was empty the next day,",

          "description_highlighted": "...In this episode, I talk with a world leading expert in sports nutrition and University of Kentucky professor, Dr Travis Thomas. We start by discussing some of Dr Thomas’ academic and research highlights related to sports nutrition. While sports nutrition can be complicated, the most successful approaches are athlete-specific and individualized, which is why it’s important to work 1-on-1 with a dietitian. Dr Thomas and I emphasize the importance of your daily diet over fancy supplements, pills and powders. The foundations of performance nutrition lie in day-to-day eating and drinking, followed by intentional fueling around workouts and competitions, and only then topped off with specific supplementation strategies. Dr Thomas and I discuss the latest research on hydration and the reliability of using urine color to assess this. Urine color is actually a valid tool we can all use to monitor hydration status daily: beware though, some foods, drinks and supplements may affect the color! We talk about different environments requiring different hydration guidelines before, during, and after exercise: however, the best approach is unique to the individual on the day. Despite being a world leading researcher in supplementation, Dr Thomas, like we do at Rise Up Nutrition, focuses on a food first approach, followed by optimizing stress levels and sleep to help athletes perform. He speaks to the importance of ensuring supplement safety and efficacy, before highlighting the four key evidence-based dietary aids: buffers like sodium bicarbonate and beta alanine, dietary nitrates, creatine, and caffeine. We differentiate between ergogenic aids and medical supplements like vitamin D and iron for those deficient, and debunk why more is not always better and can actually be harmful! We talk about affordable and accessible health and performance supplements like beetroot juice and green leafy vegetables. Sports nutrition is not just for Olympians, and Dr Thomas explains how we can all benefit from his research regardless of athleticism: similar approaches focused on elite sports nutrition can help all of us function optimally day-to-day, stay healthy and age gracefully! We explore this further with a deep dive into vitamin D, exercise and muscle function: vitamin D is not just for bone health! Whether you exercise indoors or out, maintaining optimal vitamin D levels deserves special attention. At Rise Up Nutrition, we use InsideTracker to help monitor our clients’ blood biomarkers like vitamin D, iron and more. Follow Dr Thomas on Twitter@Dr_T_0926 Dr Thomas’ Official Bio D. Travis Thomas, PhD, RDN, CSSD, LD, FAND, is an Associate Professor of Clinical &amp; Sports Nutrition and Program Director of the graduate Clinical Nutrition program in the College of Health Sciences at the University of Kentucky. Dr. Thomas is a Board Certified Specialist in Sports Dietetics (CSSD). He has held multiple volunteer and leadership positions with SCAN and served as lead author on the current Nutrition for Athletic Performance Position Stand endorsed by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, American College of Sports Medicine, and Dietitians of Canada. He was recently awarded the prestigious 2020 SCAN Achievement Award in Sports Nutrition, SCAN's first and highest award. Dr. Thomas has fourteen years’ experience conducting human studies involving nutrition and exercise interventions across the lifespan. Over the past decade, Dr. Thomas has served as an investigator on several funded research projects that focused on a wide range of nutrition issues associated with the preservation and enhancement of skeletal muscle function and performance. These studies have focused on understanding the relationship between vitamin D and muscle metabolic function, nutrition and physical function in aging and athletic populations, nutrition interventions to improve endothelial function and to reduce symptoms in patients with advanced heart failure, and investigating nutritional strategies to preserve physical performance and lean body mass in patients with cancer.  At the University of Kentucky, Dr. Thomas teaches advanced sports nutrition to graduate students and a novel undergraduate course titled “Nutrition for Injury Prevention and Rehabilitation.” Dr. Thomas also teaches and directs multiple clinical nutrition graduate courses and directs and undergraduate certificate called Nutrition for Human Performance.  This episode is brought to you by the Female Athlete System of Transformation:  Click here to Book a Call &amp; learn more Learn more about Lindsey's Services and the Team at Rise Up Nutrition: www.RiseUpNutritionRUN.com...",

In this episode, we speak with Jörg Matthias Determann about the many ways science has fueled the imagination of people in Muslim-majority contexts over the last few hundred years. In his latest book, he shows how artists and missionaries participated in &quot;cultures of astrobiology,&quot; or the study of life on other planets. Exploring the ways that a variety of authors, artists, and governments have imagined a future with and for Muslims, Matthias shows that there are many overlapping and competing visions of Muslim Futurism. « Click for More »",
